# tron-contracts

Solidity smart contracts for the [TRON](https://tron.network) blockchain.

This repository contains a library of sample smart contracts for the TRON network.

Configured with [TronBox](https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-box).

Contracts include but not limited to implementations of standard-compliant tokens, library kits, and common utilities.

## Usage

### Install tronbox:

``npm install -g tronbox``

### Clone repo:

``git clone https://github.com/tronprotocol/tron-contracts.git``

### Import Address and Private Key:

Import an address and private key of an account into the "from" and "privateKey" fields inside the tronbox.js file. Make sure it has test TRX to deploy the contracts. You can request some [here](https://www.trongrid.io/shasta/#request).

### Compile:

``tronbox compile``

### Migrate:

``tronbox migrate --reset``

## Security

At  **tron-contracts** , we prioritize quality and security. However, it's crucial to exercise prudence when dealing with contracts involving real money. These contracts are provided as-is, and TRON Foundation bears no responsibility for any outcomes arising from their use.
